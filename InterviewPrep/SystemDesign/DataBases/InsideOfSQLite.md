# SQLite
- This is a very lightweight small database system that is embaded, and it doesnt need configuration. SQLite is written in c, you can just take the open source code, and compile it, and there you go, you have a database. Its pretty simple. This is why its useful to look into it and see how it looks like. It helps understand how databases work. 
- SQLite is not meant for larg scale products, and it is very much different from Postge or mySQL, beacuse those bases are a lot more complicated
